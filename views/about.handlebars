  <p class="lead" id="aboutUs">This advertisement portal is made by 4 students currently completing a certification in full stack web development from the University of Sydney.
                                As a requirement of the certification, we were tasked with creating a major project that featured all the technologies that we have learned about. </p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p class="lead" id="aboutUsTwo">
                                However, we wanted to do more than just meet the requirements of the project. We wanted to develop a website that would have a real-world use case; a website that could somehow help people that are impacted by the pandemic.
                                We thought about small-to-medium enterprises (SME’s) that have a product-based business model. They have taken a huge blow as COVID-19 has bought about a recession, forcing people to reduce their expenses. The Business Advertisement Portal came into existence with the thought of helping these SME’s.
                                Almost all of the current advertisement channels are revenue oriented. That is why we have created an advertisement channel where product-based SME’s can advertise their products for FREE. This board only advertises discounted products. This way, while SME’s advertise their products for free, users also get access to some of the best deals in town.</p>
